    The Bitwise Algorithms are used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program.

   The operators that works at Bit level are called bitwise operators. In general there are six types of Bitwise Operators as described below:

    & (bitwise AND) Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A & B = 1.
    
    | (bitwise OR) Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A | B = 7.
    
    ^ (bitwise XOR) Takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A ^ B = 6.
    
    << (left shift) Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

    If we assume that the leading y bits are 0, then result of (x<<y) is equivalent to : 
    x * 2^y
    
    >> (right shift) Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

    The result of (x<<y) is equivalent to : 
    floor (x / 2^y)
    
    ~ (bitwise NOT) Takes one number and inverts all bits of it. Suppose A = 5, therefore ~A = -6.


    Important Facts about Bitwise Operators:
    
    The left shift and right shift operators cannot be used with negative numbers.
    
    The bitwise operators should not be used in place of logical operators.
    
    The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.
    
    The & operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd or even. The value of expression (x & 1) would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise the value would be zero.
